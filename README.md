# Khali-ma - a Ritual game for the Global Gamejam 2016
Counter the dark magics of entities unknown! Using your knowledge of items magical and mundane, create circles of elementary power that cancel out those of your foes.

#Team instructions
FOR FIRST TIME NABBING: Run git-bash.exe after getting Git Portable (link is https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.7.0.windows.1/PortableGit-2.7.0-64-bit.7z.exe)
Make a directory for your stuff to be eg "M:\Game Jam"
Go to that directory in the bash window by typing in: cd "M:\Game Jam"
Next, type: git clone https://github.com/OctarineSorcerer/Khali-ma.git
This will put a copy of Khali-ma in that directory!

STORE YOUR CHANGES
Make sure you're in the directory (with the cd thing above, but into the Khali-Ma folder too) eg: cd "M:\Game Jam\Khali-Ma"
Should say (master) after the name after that
type: git add -A
type: git commit -m "Describe what you did here"
type: git push

After this, it should ask you for your git username and password, type 'em in

WANNA GET CHANGES OTHER PEOPLE HAVE MADE ON YOURS?
Make sure you're in the directory (with the cd thing above, but into the Khali-Ma folder too) eg: cd "M:\Game Jam\Khali-Ma"
Type "git pull"
Pretty sure it'll ask you for your git username and password, type them in. Your stuff should update

SCREAM AT DAN IF IT CONFUSES YOU OR IT FUDGES UP
