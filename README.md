# Khali-ma
FOR FIRST TIME NABBING: Run git-bash.exe after getting Git Portable (link is https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.7.0.windows.1/PortableGit-2.7.0-64-bit.7z.exe)
Make a directory for your stuff to be eg "M:\Game Jam"
Go to that directory in the bash window by typing in: cd "M:\Game Jam"
Next, type: git pull https://github.com/OctarineSorcerer/Khali-ma.git
This will put a copy of Khali-ma in that directory!
